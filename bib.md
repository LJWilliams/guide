 David J. Agans: Debugging. Amacom, 2006, 0814474578. 
:   A simple guide to debugging programs, organized around nine simple
    rules. More and larger examples would have been welcome, but it is
    still a good place for novices to start.
 William G. Chase and Herbert A. Simon: "Perception in chess". Cognitive Psychology, 1973. 
:   A classic study of chunking which found that experts are actually
    *worse* than novices at remembering cases that don't match their
    mental repertoire of patterns.
 Lorenzo De Leon, William G. Harris, and Martha Evens: Is there really trouble with UNIX? In Proc. SIGCHI'83, 1983. 
:   The authors taught the usual Unix commands to one group of students,
    and made-up "English" equivalents to another. To their surprise,
    they found that the group using the regular (cryptic) commands made
    fewer errors than their peers. They speculated that this was because
    their subjects didn't associate any prior meaning with the cryptic
    commands.
 Michael Feathers: Working Effectively with Legacy Code. Prentice Hall, 2004, 0131177052. 
:   If code is exercised by unit tests, changes can be made quickly and
    safely. If it isn't, they can't, so your first job when you inherit
    legacy code should be to write some. That's where this book comes
    in. What to know three different ways to inject a test into a C++
    class without changing the code? Or which classes or methods to
    focus testing on, or how to break inter-class dependencies in Java
    so that you can test one module without having to configure the
    entire application? It's all here, along with lots of other useful
    information.
 Karl Fogel: Producing Open Source Software: How to Run a Successful Free Software Project. O'Reilly, 2005, 0596007590. 
:   This book is an excellent guide to how open source projects actually
    work. Every page offers practical advice on how to earn commit
    privileges on a project, get it more attention, or fork it in case
    of irreconcilable differences.
 Martin Fowler: Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code. Addison-Wesley, 1999, 201485672. 
:   Presents patterns that recur when programs are being reorganized.
    Some of these are well-known, such as placing common code in a
    utility method. Others, such as replacing temporary objects with
    queries or replacing constructors with factory methods, are subtler,
    but no less important. Each entry includes a section on motivation,
    the mechanics of actually carrying out the transformation, and an
    example in Java.
 David Goldberg: "What Every Computer Scientist Should Know About Floating-Point Arithmetic". ACM Computing Surveys, 23(1), March 1991. 
:   A must-read for anyone whose career depends on the correctness of
    their calculations.
 Joseph Lawrance, Christopher Bogart Margaret Burnett, Rachel Bellamy, Kyle Rector, and Scott D. Fleming: "How Programmers Debug, Revisited: An Information Foraging Theory Perspective". IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 99, 2010. 
:   A recent empirical study showing that programmers don't actually
    construct and refute hypotheses when debugging. Instead, they forage
    for information, following "scents" that past experience tells them
    are likely to lead to solutions.
 Robert Sedgewick: Algorithms in C. Addison-Wesley, 2001, 0201756080. 
:   These books are a guide to all the other conceptual tools that
    working programmers ought to have at their fingertips, from sorting
    and searching algorithms to different kinds of trees and graphs. The
    analysis is far more accessible than that of many other textbooks,
    and while the author's use of C may seem old-fashioned in an age of
    Java and C\#, it does ensure that nothing magical is hidden inside
    an overloaded operator or virtual method call.
 Toby Segaran: Programming Collective Intelligence: Building Smart Web 2.0 Applications. O'Reilly, 2007, 0596529325. 
:   A very good introduction to using clustering, collaborative
    filtering, and other statistical techniques to find knowledge (if
    not wisdom) in large data sets.
 Joel Spolsky: "The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets (No Excuses!)". [http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html), accessed January 2010. 
:   A lightweight, readable explanation of character sets, character
    encodings, and all that.
 Laura Wingerd and Christopher Seiwald: "High-level Best Practices in Software Configuration Management". Perforce Software Inc., [http://www.perforce.com/perforce/papers/bestpractices.pdf](http://www.perforce.com/perforce/papers/bestpractices.pdf), accessed October 2010. 
:   This paper, written by the creators of the Perforce version control
    system, explains how to manage code repositories when many
    developers will be working on many projects at the same time.
